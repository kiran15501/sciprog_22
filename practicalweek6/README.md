Week 6

To run the matrix multiplcation

1) Comiple command :
gcc -c main.c

gcc -c matmult.c

gcc -o matmultc main.o matmult.o

To run matmultc : 
./matmultc

or just run the Makefile

2)Comiple command :
make -f Makefile
 
To run matmultc : 
./matmultc


* In this week compute the matrix multiplication 
* The main.c file contains intialization of A matrix and B matrix and code for printing the Matrices A,B and C
* The matmult.c file contains the logic for matrix multipication 
* By compiling both the main and matmult file to object file and creating a executable file will enable us to compile both the files.
