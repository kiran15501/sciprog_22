Week 7

1) For finde.c file:

To Compile:

gcc finde.c -o finde -lm

To run:

./finde

2) For finde.c file:

To Compile:

gcc dynamic_allocation.c -o dynamic_allocation -lm

TO run:
./dynamic_allocation 

Overview:
* The value of e is estimated using Dynamic memory allocation.

* Function Factorial has been created to calculate the factorial value.

* Loop has been created for estimating the value of e.

* After computation we are releasing the allocated memory.

* With the higher order polynomials the estimate gets worse , this is because the type integer can store a maximum value of 13 factorial.

* A function allocatearray() that takes an integer as an argument and returns a pointer to an allocated memory block of that many integers.

* A function fillwithones() is created to fill every cell of the array with one.

* A function printarray() is created that takes a pointer to an array of integers and prints its elements on screen.

* A function is created to free the allocated memory.
