Fibonacci series:

Compile : gcc fibonacci.c -o fibonacci -lm

Run : ./fibonacci

We are using scanf and obtaining the values from the user.

Function is created to calculate Fibonacci series which has two input arguments Fn−1 and Fn−2.On exit they have Fn and Fn−1

A loop is constructed to print out the Fibonacci series.

Maclaurin series:

Compile : gcc maclaurin.c -o maclaurin -lm

Run : ./maclaurin

We are using scanf to obtainin the values from the user for Delta. Since Maclaurin Series is infinite, delta is used to stop the function.
* Function artanh1(x) is created to find an approximation to Maclaurin series.

* Function artanh2(x) is created to find an approximation to natural logarithms.

*The difference between the Maclaurin series approximation and the natural logarithm approximation is determined using a sample of x between -0.9 and 0.9 by 0.01.
